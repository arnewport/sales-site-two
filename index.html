            Westfork is a healthcare and business enablement platform that bridges the gap between innovation and clinical impact.  
            We connect emerging technologies with the providers that need them most—unlocking new revenue, enhancing patient care, and streamlining adoption every step of the way.

            <p class="mb-4 text-start" style="text-indent: 2em;">
            At Westfork Consulting, we're driven by a simple truth: innovation only matters when it creates real-world impact.  
            That means better care, stronger revenue, and simpler adoption for all.

            <p class="mb-5 text-start" style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Westfork's mission is to bridge the gap between emerging technologies and everyday clinical workflow—uniting purpose-built tools with expert oversight so providers and patients all benefit.
